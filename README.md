Machine Learning Case Ciphix

1. <b>Use Python.</b><br>
<i>I have created a project in github to keep track of everything. I am using python for the case.</i>

2. <b>Perform EDA on your data.</b><br>
<i>I actually didn't know what EDA was. I did a little research on internet. What I understand is that, exploratory data analysis, is an approach to research data for content features, coherence, explanatory or predictive properties.

3. <b>Preprocess your data appropriately. Think about punctuations, emoticons that should be removed from the raw text. The cleaner your data, the better the results!</b><br>
<i></i>

4. <b>Explore different (pre/pst) processing methods and explain which is best.</b>
<i></i>

5. <b>Use at least 3 machine learning algorithms in order to make sense of the
data.</b>
<i></i>

6. <b>Choose the best method by evaluation the different algorithms. Present
these findings, in a way which we can easily understand what you did.</b>
<i></i>

7. <b>Provide us with the top 10 question/types of conversations.</b>
<i></i>

8. <b>Your code should contain a notebook, which will guide as through your
project.</b>
<i></i>

9. <b>Donâ€™t forget to add a readme to your project.</b>
<i></i>

10. <b>Bonus: deploy your best model and explain how we can use it.</b>
