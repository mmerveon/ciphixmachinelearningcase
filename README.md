Machine Learning Case Ciphix

1. Use Python.
2. Perform EDA on your data.
3. Preprocess your data appropriately. Think about punctuations, emoticons
that should be removed from the raw text. The cleaner your data, the
better the results!
4. Explore different (pre/pst) processing methods and explain which is best.
5. Use at least 3 machine learning algorithms in order to make sense of the
data.
6. Choose the best method by evaluation the different algorithms. Present
these findings, in a way which we can easily understand what you did.
7. Provide us with the top 10 question/types of conversations.
8. Your code should contain a notebook, which will guide as through your
project.
9. Donâ€™t forget to add a readme to your project.
10. Bonus: deploy your best model and explain how we can use it.
